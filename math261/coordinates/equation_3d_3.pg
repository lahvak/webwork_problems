# Solution:
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION

The equation

[```[$lhs] = [$rhs]```]

represents the set of all points with the same [`z`]-coordinate [`[$rhs]`].  Since the [`z`]-coordinate gives the distance from the 
[`xy`]-plane, the points form a plane parallel to [`xy`]-plane, which in the usual placement of the axes means a _horizontal_ plane.

The point [`([$x],[$y],[$z])`] is one of those points, so the plane passes through it.
