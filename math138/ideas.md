# Ideas for college algebra problems

## Functions

### Domains

- Give domains of f and g, ask for domain of f+g, f-g, fg
- Give domains of f and g, and location of zeros of g, ask for domain of f/g
- More domain of composition
- More "find formula from graph"
- More "given a point of the graph, find the transformed point"

### Graph transformations

- describe transformation in words, ask to select graph
- give a original graph and target graph, ask to describe transformations to
  get there (fixed number of transformations, select from menu, fill in
  quantities).  Then ask for the formula.  As a feedback, graph the function
  they get.  Do it with one transformation, then two, then three.

Technical questions:

- Is there a way to show graph as a feedback for incorrect answer?  How do I
  get student's last answer when generating a problem?  How is scaffold stuff
  done?


## Polynomials

Like question 6 on the last exam: graph three power functions, give a choice of
4 or more options, ask which are graphed.
