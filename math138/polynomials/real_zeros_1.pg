BEGIN_PGML
Find all real zeros of the polynomial [` P(x) = [$pol] `].  Enter them as a comma-separated list.
If there are no real zeros, enter __none__.

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
Use the rational zero theorem and synthetic division to solve the problem.

# Solution:
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Start with the rational zero theorem, hoping we will be able to find at least two rational 
zeros so the resulting quotient will be of degree 2 and we will be able to find the 
zeros by factoring or using quadratic formula.

According to the rational zero theorem, all rational zeros of this polynomial 
will be among the possible rational zeros [`[$dispfactors]`] which we need to test.

Testing each of them using synthetic division, we find that [:[$a]:] and [:[$b]:] 
are zeros of [:P:]. The quotient after dividing by [:[$factor1]:] and [:[$factor2]:]
is [:x^2 + 1:] which has no real zeros.  Therefore [:[$a]:] and [:[$b]:] are the only real 
zeros of [:P:].
