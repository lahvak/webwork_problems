BEGIN_PGML
Find all the real zeros of the polynomial 

>>[: P = [$p] :]<<

Enter the real zeros as a comma-separated list.  If there are no real zeros, enter __none__.

Real zeros: [__________________]{$ans}

Give exact answers; no decimals. If needed, enter
square root as sqrt, e.g. the square root of 3 should be entered
as sqrt(3).

BEGIN_PGML_HINT
Use the rational zero theorem and synthetic division to solve the problem.

# Solution:
BEGIN_PGML_SOLUTION
Start with the rational zero theorem, hoping we will be able to find at least one rational 
zero so the resulting quotient will be of degree 2 and we will be able to find the 
zeros by factoring or using quadratic formula.

According to the rational zero theorem, all rational zeros of this polynomial 
will be among the possible rational zeros [`[$dispfactors]`] which we need to test.

Testing each of them using synthetic division, we find that [:[$a]:]
is a zero of [:P:]. The quotient after dividing by [:[$factor1]:]
is [:[$factor2]:] which has two real zeros, [:-1 + sqrt(2):] and [:-1 - sqrt(2):].  
Therefore the real zeros of [:P:] ate [:[$a]:], [:-1 + sqrt(2):] and [:-1 - sqrt(2):].
